<h1>Eleve Couture - Luxury Fashion Store</h1>

</div>

A conceptualised online luxury fashion store which sells high-end clothing and accessories for men and women from a series of high-fidelity mockups generated in Figma, using UI Prototyping, components and auto-layout.

This store has been built front-end using Next and SASS (SCSS) with Sanity Studio, Stripe and Redux to handle back-end data and State Management. ESLint, Prettier and StrictMode have also been configured. The store allows users to select products, including quantities, and then purchase them. The gateway has been configured to test mode, so no payments are carried out. This repo is currently under development.

<strong>Features</strong>

 - Single Page Application (SPA) which leverages Next 13 app routing
 - Sanity Studio to handle back-end data incl. schemas
 - Redux to handle state management of data across pages and components
 - Stripe gateway to handle payments
 - SASS (SCSS) to style the interface
